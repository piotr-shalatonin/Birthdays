# Birthdays

ReadMe

Small description:
I implemented Birthdays app using SwiftUI + Combine
Currently I am using the same tech stack on my proect and I like this new library.

Steps to start project:
- run XCode Version 13.2.1
- open Birthdays.xcodeproj
- Run on simulator like iPhone 13 (iOS 15.2)

Tech details:
- I used MVVN pattern. Each screen contains view model that implements all business logic
not related to the UI and can be covered with unit tests
- All strings are in Localizable.strings
- 

Not finished:
- GlobalUtils.constructURL - not finished. Should compose API url with parameters
- Loading data indicator, when API calls are performing
- Apply Roboto fonts
- Set colors for the project in colors.xcassets

For the git commit message I used the following format:
